# Vi Coding Assignment 

__Both Vi and myself are huge Marvel fans!
At their request I prepared a small home assignment to get some interesting data regarding Marvel movie and actors.
The server can collect data from TMDB website using their 3rd party API system, populate and aggregate the data and return the necessary values.
The server can fetch all movies for a specific actor, provide necessary information on who played more then one marvel character as well as return characters who were played by more then one actor.__
